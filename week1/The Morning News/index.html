/* So my biggest problem is probably CSS.  I only know html and CSS to the extent that we learned in CAS 204.  I don't really know how to separate things past the usual h1,h2,h3 tags, hence the reason for the really bad clone. */

<p>It&#8217;s National Bike to Work Day today, and maybe you noticed a lot of cyclists on your commute this morning. If you didn&#8217;t—and you&#8217;re a driver—that&#8217;s cause for concern. A plea for safety from cyclists to motorists.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that one of our co-founders, Rosecrans Baldwin, has a new book out about his stint living and working in France, inspired by the letters he wrote for TMN.</p>
</div>
<p>On Tuesday, Rosecrans and Paul Ford will read <a href="http://kgbbar.com/calendar/events/true_story_nonfiction20/">at New York City&rsquo;s KGB Bar at 7 p.m.</a>. Rosecrans and Paul <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60A1EFD345B0C728FDDA90994DD404482&amp;pagewanted=2">have an unlikely friendship</a>, but we&rsquo;re pretty sure this will be an event that TMN fans will not want to miss. Plus, there&rsquo;s a party afterward.

<p>Every Friday we take a look back at <a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/archive/headlines/">the week&rsquo;s headlines</a>, centering on a theme we&rsquo;ve singled out as particularly important. This week, the opinion column&rsquo;s wrath bled well beyond its confines with the headlines full of people calling others out, correcting them, and setting them straight.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/04/27/middle_east_coverage_is_full_of_lies">Corrections to stories from the Middle East&mdash;e.g., &ldquo;farewell sex&rdquo;&mdash;that were too good last week to fact-check</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Blame it on journalists unfamiliar with their subject matter, the demands of an ever-quicker news cycle, or simply salacious stories that were &ldquo;too good to check.&rdquo;</p>

<p>People complain that politics are worse than ever. It happens to be true. But history contains as many examples of the contentious, weird, and wacky as the present—and those absurdities are actually vital to our democracy.</p>

<p>Every Friday we take a look back at <a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/archive/headlines/">the week&rsquo;s headlines</a>, centering on a theme we&rsquo;ve singled out as particularly important. From the difficulties of dealing pot or having too much to read and learn, to being the biggest working comic without being famous, it&rsquo;s never as easy as you think, and there&rsquo;s rarely a simple answer to fix things. The headlines this week continued to remind us to shed conventional wisdom in favor of understanding the complexity of an issue.</p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303302504577323610476758908.html">Two takes on recent pan-African development</a>:</p>

<p>There is no magic recipe for turning countries around, Mr. Severino writes, only good cooks. He believes that 20 years after democracy was prescribed to Africa by the West, there are the beginnings of local democratic activities all over the continent that are forcing governments to deliver.</p>
